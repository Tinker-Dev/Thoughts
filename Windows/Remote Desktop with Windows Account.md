# Remote Desktop with Windows Account

When you are going to login to a machine with RDP that is using a Windows Account you will find that it wonâ€™t let you in. Outside of performing the normal process for setting up RDP you have to complete one more step.

  

Open and Command Prompt and enter your variation of this.

```
runas /u:MicrosoftAccount\your@email.com cmd.exe

```

  

This will tie and alias of sorts to the account on the machine that will allow things to work.
