# Kill a Process

From time to time you have a process that just keeps running and you needed to stop it. If you don't have admin right there is a good chance that you don't have access to the Task Manager. If you run this in the command prompt there is a good chance that you can stop that process.  

```
taskkill /F /IM "EXCEL.EXE" /T

pause

```
