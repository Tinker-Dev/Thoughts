# Clearing the Console

From time to time you need to display something on the screen that needs to get someone's attention. The best way to do that is to clear the screen and then display what you are needing to show them. Here is how you go about doing that.  

  

```
# Imports
import os

# BLAH BLAH BLAH

os.system('cls')  # This is what you are looking for. The rest is just filler.
print('')
print('Everything has been processed.')
print('')
input('Press Enter to close this window.')

```
